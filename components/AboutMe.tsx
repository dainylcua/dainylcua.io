        About Me
      </h2>
      <div>
        <p>Hi! I am Dainyl Cua, and I create full-stack applications with a purpose. I also dabble in writing technical content aimed at developers; I hope I can help you learn a thing or two!</p>
        <p>I graduated from Texas A&M University in 2020 with a Bachelors of Science in Chemical Engineering. I worked at an environmental consulting agency for 9 months, lost my job due to COVID, and started my journey into tech. After learning the fundamentals of web devlopment, I studied Software Engineering at General Assembly&apos;s coding bootcamp, then developed a prototype Jamstack EdTech website under my instructor, and worked at Twilio, the industry leader for cloud communications.</p>
        <p>Out of work, you&apos;ll find me playing Dungeons & Dragons, gaming, cooking and baking, or messing with my pets! That is, if I haven&apos;t found something new to try out.</p>
